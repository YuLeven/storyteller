# Feature log

## 2026-09-29 — Campaign and session foundation

- Added a reviewed campaign setup with title, premise, setting, tone, narration language, and player character details.
- Added a persistent campaign list and detail page with session history, resume links, archive, and restore actions.
- Campaign creation saves the campaign and its first session together. Starting a later session closes the previous active session in the same transaction; a database index enforces one active session per campaign.
- Added a fictional QA campaign seed, separate campaign fixtures for tests, and WSL/PostgreSQL setup notes. No vineyard data is included in the QA seed or automated fixtures.
- Bound the LiveView server to `127.0.0.1:4000`, restricted development WebSocket origins to `127.0.0.1:4000` and `localhost:4000`, and disabled sensitive DB details in connection errors.
- **Checked:** `mix format` completed, the focused Campaign/LiveView suite passed (13 tests, 0 failures), and the complete suite passed (18 tests, 0 failures). Development migrations ran against `storyteller_dev`; automated tests used `storyteller_test`.

The resumed session page currently confirms stored campaign/session setup; the turn timeline and AI resolution are later features.
